# Sleepless
A program that tries to stop you from falling asleep.
My friend was concerned about falling asleep while they were working so I made a program to try to stop that.
It uses a fixed version of Chris10M/open-eye-detector to check if your eyes are closed or face isn't visible for more than 5 seconds and play a sound until you stop it.
It plays whatever file is in the same directory as it and is named "sound".
You can stop the sound looping by pressing "space" and exit by pressing "q".
